                    I'm an aspiring full-stack software engineer based in Greater Seattle Area, WA. I've been sharpening my coding skills at App Academy's Full-time Software Engineering Program. My toolkit includes JavaScript, Python, React, Redux, Node, Express, SQL, SQLAlchemy, Flask, and Postgres. I've tackled a variety of projects, from full-stack web apps to algorithmic puzzles. And if that's not enough, I even have a few years of experience in the exciting world of fintech, e-commerce, and e-logistics as a Product Ops Manger. In this role, I gained expertise in product operations and management, strategy planning, user experience, project management and data analysis. I like to think of myself as a jack-of-all-trades, but don't just take my word for it ðŸ˜‚.
